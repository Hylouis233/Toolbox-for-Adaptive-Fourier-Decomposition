Toolbox for Adaptive Fourier Decomposition
=====================================================================

This toolbox is intended to help users use the adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD) easily. This toolbox contains different implementations of the AFD for different types of processed signals and different decomposition process.

The AFD is an **adaptive signal decomposition**:

+ Compared with the conventional signal decomposition methods, e.g. Fourier decomposition and wavelet decomposition, the AFD uses **adaptive orthogonal basis**. These adaptive basis can make the decomposition components match the processed signals best and thus can provide good time-frequency resolution without pre-defined basis. 
+ Compared with other adaptive decomposition methods, e.g. empirical mode decomposition (EMD), the AFD has the **rigorous mathematical foundation**, which allowed users further analyze detailed decomposition coefficients and decomposition components.

According to above characteristics, the AFD can applied to many different areas:

+ Adaptive feature extraction (for further signal classification or recognition)
