Toolbox for Adaptive Fourier Decomposition
=====================================================================

This toolbox is intended to help users use the adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD) **easily**. 

This toolbox contains **different implementations** of the AFD for different types of processed signals and different decomposition process.

There is a `simple online demo <http://zewang.site/AFD>`_ based on Python version v1.0. You can try the AFD quickly.

This toolbox includes

+ Core AFD:

  + Single channel: 
  
    + without FFT (slow)
    + with FFT (fast)
  
  + Multi-channel:

    + without FFT (slow)
    + with FFT (fast)

+ Unwinding AFD:

  + Single channel: 
  
    + without FFT (slow)
    + with FFT (fast)

  + Multi-channel:

    + without FFT (slow)
    + with FFT (fast)
